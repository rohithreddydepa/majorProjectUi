        With the increase in online education, the number of platforms
        supporting question answer forums are increasing. Out of platforms like
        Stack Overflow, Coursera, Quora, Stack Overflow is one of the most
        popular online question-answer forums and there is a huge amount of
        information in this forum. So, to make the system efficient, it is very
        necessary to detect the class to which a particular piece of information
        belongs to. This detection is called tagging. It helps in easy retrieval
        and organization of data. Our project aims at developing a system for
        autonomously detecting the tags of Stack Overflow questions using NLP
        and Machine Learning.

        The size of the data is a hindrance to improve the system. Currently,
        websites like Quora are expecting users to manually enter the tags
        related to their queries. But, manual tagging is a difficulty for the
        end user causing poor user experience. So, an autonomous question
        tagging system is necessary.

        To solve this problem, we are using a multi label classification system
        that makes use of Natural Language Processing and good classifier
        algorithms to label the questions on the forums with their appropriate
        tags autonomously. This auto-labelling framework makes it very easy for
        the users to find answers for the queries posted, given significant tags
        for the same.

        This system has a wide range of applications in multiple other websites
        that contain a lot of information or are question-answer based forums
        other than Stack Overflow like Quora, Coursera etc. The ultimately can
        make such platforms capable of inferring the tags of posts autonomously
        and improve the user experience big time.
