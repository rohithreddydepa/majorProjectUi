          With the increase in online education, the number of platforms
          supporting question answer forums are increasing. Out of platforms
          like Stack Overflow, Coursera, Quora, Stack Overflow is one of the
          most popular online question-answer forums and there is a huge amount
          of information in this forum. So, to make the system efficient, it is
          very necessary to detect the most probable class to which a particular piece of
          information belongs to.
          <span class="bold">This detection is called tagging.</span>
          It helps in easy retrieval and organization of data. Our project aims
          at developing a system for autonomously detecting the tags of Stack
          Overflow questions using NLP and Machine Learning.This will benefit both the
          people who post questions and the ones who answer them. For answering, people can choose the topic
          in which they are interested and can filter out the irrelevant questions. 
          People who post questions can get the answers faster if the right tag is identified.

          The size of the data is a hindrance to improve the system. Currently,
          websites like Quora are expecting users to manually enter the tags
          related to their queries. But, manual tagging is a difficulty for the
          end user and causing poor user experience.

            If this appears again check in the console if you have CORS error. If
            you have, you can install the CORS error extension to resolve the
            CORS error.

          To solve this problem, we created a Machine Learning model using NLP.
          which is <a class="bold" href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction/data">built on a Kaggle dataset.</a>
          The data obtained from Kaggle has four fields-ID, Title, Body and the
          associated Tag in CSV format (Title is the heading of the question and body is
          its description). There are a
          <span class="bold">total of 6 millon records</span> in the dataset and
          the count of few of the most frequent tags is in the donut chart above.

          We first preprocess the data, we are using a multi label
          classification system that makes use of Natural Language Processing
          and good classifier algorithms to label the questions on the forums
          with their appropriate tags autonomously. This auto-labelling
          framework makes it very easy for the users to find answers for the
          queries posted, given significant tags for the same.

          We have used this model in this website.In predict page, user can paste
          their question and enter predict so that API will respond to the user
          with the appropriate tag from the model . If it is unable to predict
          the tag then it will ask for more data to predict.

  This Project has a wide range of applications in multiple other websites that
  contain a lot of information or are question-answer based forums other than
  Stack Overflow, like Quora, Coursera etc. Ultimately we can make such platforms
  capable of inferring the tags of posts autonomously and improve the user
  experience big time.
